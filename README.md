# Problem set

Problems that were solved by specific model in the repository.
# 1) Regression

* #### Simple linear regression 
   Simple Linear regression model to estimate the salary of employees based on no. of years of experience
* #### Multiple Linear Regression
   The dataset contains investment of various startups in their different department & we have to estimate the profit of that company based on these features
* #### Polynomial Linear Regression 
   The dataset contains the designation of a company ‘A’ and base salary for that employee. The nature of data is exponential if seen in graph & to estimate salary of an employee in that company a polynomial regression model is required.
    An interviewee who was working in company ‘A’ was asked for his previous salary by new company ‘X’ who has this data of company ‘A’. He replied ‘$16,000’. He was in level 6 & have half of experience needed to get into level 7 (i.e level 6.5)Tell whether he is honest or not.
* #### Support Vector Regression (SVR)
   The dataset contains the designation of a company ‘A’ and base salary for that employee. The nature of data is exponential if seen in graph & to estimate salary of an employee in that company a polynomial regression model is required.

# 2) Classification

* #### Logistic Regression
   The dataset contains information about users and whether they bought an SUV or not.
    The job is to create a model to predict whether a certain user is going to buy an SUV or not.
* #### K-Nearest neighbors (K-NN)
   The dataset contains information about users and whether they bought an SUV or not.
    The job is to create a model to predict whether a certain user is going to buy an SUV or not.
* #### Kernel SVM
   The dataset contains information about users and whether they bought an SUV or not.
    The job is to create a model to predict whether a certain user is going to buy an SUV or not.
* #### Bayes theorem
   The dataset contains information about users and whether they bought an SUV or not.
    The job is to create a model to predict whether a certain user is going to buy an SUV or not.
* #### Decision Tree Classification
   The dataset contains information about users and whether they bought an SUV or not.
    The job is to create a model to predict whether a certain user is going to buy an SUV or not.
* #### Random Forest Classification
   The dataset contains information about users and whether they bought an SUV or not.
    The job is to create a model to predict whether a certain user is going to buy an SUV or not.

# 3) Clustering

* #### K-means clustering
   The dataset contains various information of clients of a shopping mall & the idea is to group same type of user together and find such a number of groups.
* #### Hierarchical clustering
   The dataset contains various information of clients of a shopping mall & the idea is to group same type of user together and find such a number of groups.

# 4) Association Rule Learning

* #### Apriori
   The dataset contains the number of transactions of a shop during a week. Each row contains various items purchased.
    The task is to find items which are most associated to each other. If one is bought other is most likely to be bought.
    
    Note: Dataset does not containtain any header.

# 5) Reinforcement Learning

* #### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
   The dataset contains the binary values where 1 means the ad was clicked and 0 means not. (better say number of times clicked)
    Rows implies the user i and column shows the ad number. Thus the data shows how many times a user clicked a certain ad.
    The idea is to build a model which predicts which ad is going to be more as the users start clicking them. th e ads_selected variable shows which ad is most likely to be best for time t+1 and the add which is most likely to converge will be repeatedly seen at last.
* #### Thompson Sampling
   The dataset contains the binary values where 1 means the ad was clicked and 0 means not. (better say number of times clicked)
    Rows implies the user i and column shows the ad number. Thus the data shows how many times a user clicked a certain ad.
    The idea is to build a model which predicts which ad is going to be more as the users start clicking them. th e ads_selected variable shows which ad is most likely to be best for time t+1 and the add which is most likely to converge will be repeatedly seen at last.

# 6) Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    
*  The dataset contains a tsv file which has reviews by user to a restaurant at each row     . one column for the review and other for whether they liked the restaurant or not.
    
# 7) Dimensionality Reduction

* #### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   The dataset contains various parameters of a wine and type of customer ( 1 to 3 ) associated with that type of wine.
    The idea is to reduce the dimension of the dataset and classify the type of user (we will use logistic regression here) based on wine input.
* #### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
   The dataset contains various parameters of a wine and type of customer ( 1 to 3 ) associated with that type of wine.
    The idea is to reduce the dimension of the dataset and classify the type of user (we will use logistic regression here) based on wine input.
